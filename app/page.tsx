                {`
        We are a student-led engineering team 
        based at Monash University
        in Melbourne, Australia. 
        Since 2015 we have been designing,
        manufacturing, and racing fully-faired human-powered vehicles (HPVs)
        to push the limits of human speed.`}

            Our mission
          </h2>
          <p className="my-2">
            Our team’s vision is to make the fastest HPV in Australia, and
            eventually the world. We’re hoping to break the HPV land-speed
            record in Australia (currently 96.7km/h) having ridden at faster
            speeds during the 2023 World Human Powered Speed Challenge, an
            international competition in the U.S. which we plan to return to in
            2025. With support from Monash University and the Engineering
            faculty, we strive to provide a space where Monash students can
            develop valuable, real-world experience which they can carry on into
            their careers. Alongside our technical goals, we also aim to promote
            STEAM to the wider community within the framework of HPVs through
            school outreach programs.
